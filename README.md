My story:
    
       I started my journey in computers with a Gateway computer. The model is an older one, and I was naive with it. 
    I ended up ruining the battery on it since I would game with it with the charger still attached. I then moved into an
    Acer, which was so slim that it needs an adapter for the VGA and the Ethernet cables. As time went on, my Acer slowly
    lost more and more space. However, one day I was watching a vlog by Markiplier(YouTube celebrity) and talked about
    putting together his computer. When he mentioned that it was cheaper for a lot more output than buying one off the
    market, I decided to research on parts.
    
       I found a website that is called PCPartPicker (http://www.pcpartpicker.com/) and found out so much from that website
    that I had no idea about! What I found out is that every part correlates to one another: the case with the motherboard
    with the power and so on. Once you select the parts, the website will check to see if the parts you selected will be
    compatible with one another. It even goes as far as checking several websites to see which website has the best price,
    and has a graph to tell you if it is the lowest thus far or if the part hasn't been going down at all.
    
        After long debate, I decided I wanted to create one on my own: a gaming computer at first, but then later on creating
    videos to post on YouTube. My list I decided on (and continuing to build on) is at
    http://pcpartpicker.com/user/HisServant/saved/FwxgXL . I say add on because I will get another hard drive (solid state)
    and graphics cards and what not. The world of technology is evolving. It will be tomorrow and the newest processor will
    be released. So in order to be ahead, one should have the ability to be customizable. In my opinion, if you know your
    computer to its very core, then you can troubleshoot any problem that affects it, and know what to replace or upgrade on
    it to be involved in the evolving technological world today.

Once you have all the parts needed for the computer to function:
    - Make sure you have a monitor to test computer on.

Step 1:  Open the case. 
          *** Fans, external USB connection, power button, and internal speaker come with case. 
          
Step 2:  Install the power supply into the case in its proper position. 

Step 3:  Install the hard drive into the optical drive location. 

Step 4 (OPTIONAL): Install the cd/dvd drive into the optical drive location.

Step 5 (Optional): Install the GPU(Graphic card) into the PCI Slot 

Step 6:  Install the motherboard where there are bumpers in the case to keep metal from touching the motherboard. 

Step 7:  Install RAM into the RAM slots on the motherboard. 

Step 8:  Install the CPU into the specified socket on the motherboard, making sure that the triangled corner matches with the motherboard. 

Step 9:  Install heat sink on top of the CPU. Do not forget that if there is thermo-paste with the Heat Sink.

Step 10:  Plug power/data cords into their slots.

          - SATA cables: these should run from hard drive and cd/dvd drive to the motherboard where the designated SATA ports
          are for data. For power supply, SATA cables run from power supply to the hard drive and cd/dvd drive. 
          - ATX power cables: these come straight from the power supply to the motherboard. The exact spot to be plugged is
          designated on the motherboard.
          - CPU-Fan connection: comes from the heat sink to the unique plug on the motherboard.
          - Cooling fans: these should run from the fans to the motherboard plug labeled "fan 1 / fan 2". 
          - Internal speaker: plug into specified slot.
          - Power button: plug into motherboard where appropriate.
          - External USB connections: plug into motherboard where appropriate (if not already installed). 
          --The best thing to do in this step if there is no label on the motherboard to distinguish where each cable goes,
          check the physical manual (if provided) or go online to those manuals to find out which plugs go where.
          
Step 11:  Check all the computer peripherals by the process called POST (Power On Self Test) 

Step 12:  Close case. Plug power cord into outlet and computer. 

Step 13:  Press power button, and if all done correctly, computer should turn on with no problems or beeps.

Lessons Learned:

1) Make sure RAM is secured into RAM slots, if not, when you turn the computer on, you may hear beeps. Reseat the RAM. 

2) Make sure the CPU is facing the correct way in its slot on the motherboard. 

3) Make sure power button has power to it. 

4) Double check to make sure CPU comes with a heat sink. 

5) Make sure you have a hard drive if you want to use an OS and install applications.
